1. I'd like to fetch tweets/photos/etc. which are marked private in my feeds,
   but I don't see anywhere to configure that. What gives?
   
   Djangregator was written with the use-case of integration with a blog,
   which is usually a public forum. If you have private items in your
   Flickr photostream, or you have made your tweets private, then it doesn't
   make very much sense to publicly display them elsewhere, does it?
   
   In other words: I don't have any use for this feature. If somebody comes up
   with a compelling reason to add it, I might. Otherwise -- submit patches
   or fork to your heart's content.
